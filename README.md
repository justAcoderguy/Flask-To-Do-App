# Flask-To-Do-App
A very minimalist To-Do app created with Flask just to get used to the Framework!


This is my first website - app developed using the micro framework Flask. I used SQLAlchemy as my database to store the todo id etc. 
The basic styling has been done using Semantic UI

Thanks for viewing!
